# overloadfight.club roadmap tracker

## What this is

The execution queue for the plan in `docs/overload-fight-club-roadmap.html`
(published at https://app.superset.sh/page/overload-fight-club-roadmap-n9wpxv).
The plan came from four audits (data, UX, performance, features) run on
2026-10-06 against commit `10223be`. The condensed audit notes with file:line
references live in `docs/audit/`.

The work is done one session at a time, each in a fresh context. Every session
owns exactly one item from the queue below, lands it as a PR, updates this file
in the same PR, and writes the prompt for the next session at the bottom.

## How to use this file

Each session:

1. Read this file top to bottom. Verify the status line against the repo before
   trusting anything (see "On resume").
2. Take the first unchecked session in the queue unless the user names another.
3. Work on a branch `ofc/sNN-<slug>` based on `origin/main`. Open a PR to
   `main`. Never merge it; merging publishes a Docker image to GHCR `latest`.
4. Before ending: tick the session's box, fill its "Validated" and "NOT
   validated" lists, add decisions to the register, append to the session log,
   re-read the status line and counts at the top and correct them, then rewrite
   the "Next session prompt" section. Commit the tracker change in the same PR
   as the work.
5. End the turn at the phase boundary. Do not start the next session's work.

On resume:

- Confirm the SHA in the status line still exists and the branch named there
  is still where the tracker says it is. If `main` moved, diff the delta before
  building.
- Re-run one verification command and compare with its last recorded result.
- Treat the NOT validated list as unknown, not as broken.
- If the repo contradicts this file, the repo wins. Record the contradiction in
  the session log.

## Status

S1 is on branch `ofc/s01-secrets-auth`, based on `origin/main` at `5516729`,
PR __PR__ open and not merged, 2026-10-06. The branch's first commit adds
`docs/`, so later sessions base on S1's branch until it merges, then on
`origin/main`.

On 2026-10-06 the repo owner purged the leaked password from history and
force-pushed `main`. Every commit SHA changed. The audits' base `10223be` is
now `2c4f174`, with identical code apart from the redacted password, so the
audits' file:line references still hold. `5516729` came after the audits and
touches only `scripts/` and `.gitignore`. Old clones still hold the
pre-rewrite history: work from a fresh clone and never push a branch that
descends from `10223be`. The local docs branch
`overload-site-redesign-13ed9872` is on the old history; do not use it.

Counts: 1 of 28 sessions done (PR open, not merged). Phase 1: 1/6. Phase 2:
0/5. Phase 3: 0/6. Phase 4: 0/11.

## Validated (as of 2026-10-06, audits at 10223be = 2c4f174 after the rewrite, S1 on `ofc/s01-secrets-auth` at 5516729)

- Scripts: the password was in five tracked scripts, not the three listed
  here before; the grep pattern missed `inspect_ds1515b.py` and
  `update_reverse_proxy.py`, which target `192.168.0.105`. The owner's commit
  `5516729` on `main` fixed all of them plus `docker_build_synology.py`: each
  reads `NAS_SSH_PASSWORD` and exits if it is unset (no `getpass` prompt).
  S1 dropped its own script changes in favour of that commit. On `5516729`,
  `grep -rnE "password=['\"]" scripts/` prints nothing, and `git log -p -S`
  for the old password over `origin/main` finds nothing.
- S1, startup: on Node 22.17.0, `NODE_ENV=production npm start` with both
  secrets unset prints `Refusing to start: ADMIN_PASSWORD and SESSION_SECRET
  must be set when NODE_ENV=production. See .env.example.` and exits 1 before
  creating any file in `DATA_DIR`. With only `SESSION_SECRET` unset it names
  just that one. With both set it starts and `/api/stats/global` returns JSON
  (`total_games: 25` after the startup sync). Without `NODE_ENV` it logs a
  warning and `admin123` logs in.
- S1, routes (curl against the running server): without a session,
  `/api/overload/status`, `/api/overload/pilot/Soup`, `POST
  /api/overload/install`, `POST /api/overload/pilots/delete`, `POST
  /api/fight-nights/check` and `POST /api/analyze-match` return 401. After
  login, `/api/overload/status` and `POST /api/fight-nights/check` return 200.
  `/api/import/warmup` stays public (200).
- S1, pilot names: logged in, a clone to `../../evil` and settings for `../x`
  return `Invalid pilot name`. `npx vitest run` passes 3 tests; removing the
  guard in `getPilotData` makes the traversal test fail.
- S1, login: ten wrong passwords return 401, the eleventh and twelfth 429, and
  the right password from the same IP is also 429 until the window ends.
  Fifty wrong passwords, each with a different `X-Forwarded-For`, return 401
  and then 429 from the 51st (the cap across all clients). After a restart the
  right password returns 200, and a password one character shorter or longer
  returns 401. The session cookie carries `Secure` when the request has
  `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` and not on plain HTTP.
- S1, compose: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config` with neither
  secret set fails with `required variable ADMIN_PASSWORD is missing a value`.
  With both set, both appear in the rendered environment. Checked with Docker
  Desktop's `docker compose` v2, not the NAS's `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose`.
- `server/routes.js:723` pins `gemini-2.0-flash`. Checked by grep.
- CSP at `server/index.js:70-74` has no `frame-src`; COEP is `require-corp`.
  Read from source.
- Production bundle: one JS chunk, 1,291.65 KB raw / 351.00 KB gzip, built with
  `npx vite build` on Node 24 after `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. No `React.lazy`
  or dynamic `import()` anywhere in the client.
- `public/ffmpeg-core.wasm` (32,232,419 bytes) is a duplicate of
  `public/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-core.wasm` and nothing references the root copy.
- `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` are not in `package.json`; `tsc
  --noEmit --strict` reports 6,135 errors.

## NOT validated, do not claim these work

- Every data-math claim in `docs/audit/data.md` (BLUE/ORANGE scoring, guessed
  durations, no-op hydration, overwrite of hydrated games) was read from code.
  No database exists in the worktree, so none was reproduced against real
  rows. Reproduce with a fixture before and after fixing.
- The calendar iframe being blocked was inferred from headers plus a curl of
  the Google embed's resource policy, not observed in a browser.
- Mobile overflow at 375 px and nav crowding between 768 and 1,150 px were
  inferred from CSS.
- Whether the single-thread ffmpeg core still needs COOP/COEP.
- Whether the DSM reverse proxy on `192.168.0.105` sends `X-Forwarded-For`
  and `X-Forwarded-Proto`. S1 sets `trust proxy` to one hop and relies on both
  (per-IP login limit, `Secure` cookie). The existing HTTPS redirect already
  reads `X-Forwarded-Proto`, which suggests it is sent, but nobody checked
  on the NAS.
- None of the SSH scripts was run against the NAS after `5516729`.
- Whether GitHub still serves the pre-rewrite commits by SHA. Purged commits
  can stay reachable by direct SHA until GitHub garbage-collects them.
- The taunt and pilot-settings pages for a visitor who is not logged in were
  not opened in a browser. `/api/overload/status` now returns 401 for them;
  `OverloadFsContext` reads that as "no server access" and falls back to the
  browser folder picker, which is what the code says should happen.
- The Docker image was not built or run with the new compose files.

## Ground rules

- One session, one queue item, one PR. No auto-chaining into the next item.
- Never merge a PR. Never push to `main`. A push to `main` builds and publishes
  `ghcr.io/jasonjkehoe-alt/overloadfight.club:latest`.
- No Co-Authored-By or other attribution trailers in commit messages.
- Surgical diffs: touch only what the item needs. Adjacent dead code gets a
  line in "Flagged, not fixed", not a deletion.
- Match existing style (Tailwind utility classes, functional React, ES modules
  on the server). Do not introduce a router library, state library or ORM
  without a decision entry here.
- Every stat change ships with a test on fixture games
  (`gamelist_sample.json`, `game_detail_sample.json`). The test runner is
  decided in S1 (see Decisions).
- Secrets come from the environment only. Nothing secret in tracked files.
- Prose the user reads (PR descriptions, this file) follows the `unslop` skill.
- A hook blocks reading any file over 350 lines in one go. Read sections with
  `sed -n 'START,ENDp' <file>` or `grep -n`.

## Canonical contract, do not change without asking

- The tracker's upstream data shape: `types.ts` (`GameData`, `PlayerData`,
  `KillEvent`, `DamageEvent`) and the two sample files at the repo root. The
  tracker at `tracker.otl.gg` owns this shape; the site adapts to it.
- The `games(id, date, ip, details)` table and the hot/cold split
  (`server/db.js:37-54`). New tables may be added beside it; it is not
  replaced until S5 lands a migration with a decision entry.
- The public API paths listed in `services/apiService.ts`. Add endpoints;
  rename or remove only with a decision entry.

## Environment

- Repo: `git@github.com:jasonjkehoe-alt/overloadfight.club.git`. The local
  clone at `~/Repositories/claude/overloadfight.club` may be stale; always
  `git fetch origin` and base work on `origin/main`.
- Node: use 22 (`nvm use 22`; 22.17.0 is installed). Node 24 cannot compile
  `better-sqlite3`.
- Install: `npm ci`. For a client-only build on Node 24, `npm ci
  --ignore-scripts` works.
- Build: `npx vite build` (do not use `npm run build`; its `prebuild` rewrites
  the tracked `public/version.json`).
- Run locally: `PORT=3100 DATA_DIR=/tmp/ofc-data npm start`. The server creates
  empty databases. There is no production data locally; use the sample JSON
  files as fixtures.
- Env vars the server reads: `PORT`, `DATA_DIR`, `NODE_ENV`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`,
  `SESSION_SECRET`, `REDIS_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`. None are set locally.
  `.env.example` lists them. Without `NODE_ENV=production` the server falls
  back to `admin123` and a dev session secret with a warning; with it, both
  secrets are required. The SSH scripts in `scripts/` read `NAS_SSH_PASSWORD`
  and exit if it is unset.
- No ports or databases are shared between worktrees. Pick a port above 3100.
- Deploy: push to `main` → GitHub Actions builds and pushes the image. The NAS
  pulls it manually (`docker-compose.prod.yml`, see `DEPLOYMENT.md`).

## Verification

| Command | Expected | Last result | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| `grep -rnE "password=['\"]" scripts/` | no output after S1 | no output (S1) | 2026-10-06 |
| `nvm use 22 && npm ci` | installs, `better-sqlite3` compiles | 443 packages, compiles on 22.17.0 | 2026-10-06 |
| `npx vitest run` | all pass | 1 file, 3 tests pass | 2026-10-06 |
| `NODE_ENV=production PORT=3100 DATA_DIR=/tmp/ofc-data npm start` without `ADMIN_PASSWORD`/`SESSION_SECRET` | exits 1 with a message naming both | exits 1, message names both | 2026-10-06 |

| `npx tsc --noEmit` | 0 errors (meaningful only after S6 installs React types) | 0 errors, JSX untyped | 2026-10-06 |
| `PORT=3100 DATA_DIR=/tmp/ofc-data npm start` then `curl -s localhost:3100/api/stats/global` | JSON body | JSON, `total_games: 25` (with both secrets, `NODE_ENV=production`) | 2026-10-06 |
| Negative check: `git diff --stat origin/main -- . ':!docs'` on the tracker-only branch | empty | empty | 2026-10-06 |

## [HUMAN] tasks

- [ ] [HUMAN] Rotate the SSH password for user `jkehoe` on `192.168.0.52` and
      on `192.168.0.105` (the same password was used for both). It was public
      in git history until the purge and must be treated as leaked.
- [x] [HUMAN] Scrub history. Done by the owner on 2026-10-06: password
      replaced with `REDACTED` in every commit, `main` force-pushed.
- [ ] [HUMAN] Before pulling the S1 image on the NAS, put `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and
      `SESSION_SECRET` in a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.prod.yml`
      (see `.env.example`). Compose no longer hard-codes `admin123`, and the
      server refuses to start in production without both. The owner said on
      2026-10-06 he will create it before merging.
- [ ] [HUMAN] Delete old local clones and re-clone, as the owner asked. Old
      clones (including `~/Repositories/claude/overloadfight.club` and the
      Superset worktrees that share its `.git`) still hold the pre-rewrite
      history. Pulling into them or pushing a branch from the old history
      would bring the purged commits back.
- [ ] [HUMAN] Create a Discord webhook URL for the fight-night channel (needed
      by S18).
- [x] [HUMAN] Add GitHub user `kehoej` as a collaborator. Done 2026-10-06.
- [ ] [HUMAN] Merge each PR. Pull the new image on the NAS.

## Session queue

Effort tags: S under half a day, M a day, L two or more days of agent work.

### Phase 1: fast and true

- [x] **S1 Secrets and auth hardening** (S). PR __PR__. Script items done by
      the owner's `5516729`. Done when: `grep -rnE
      "password=['\"]" scripts/` is empty; the three scripts read credentials
      from env or prompt; `server/auth.js` refuses to start with
      `NODE_ENV=production` unless `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `SESSION_SECRET` are
      set; `.env.example` exists; the pilot-file routes (`bridgeRoutes`, mounted at `server/index.js:91`
      mount), `POST /api/fight-nights/check`, `POST /api/analyze-match` and
      `POST /api/overload/install` require the admin session; pilot names used
      in file paths are validated against `^[A-Za-z0-9 _.-]{1,32}$`
      (`server/services/overloadBridge.js`); login has a rate limit; session
      cookie is `secure` behind HTTPS. A test runner (vitest) is added with one
      test for the path validator.
- [ ] **S2 Stat correctness** (M). Done when: a shared `server/lib/gameParse.js`
      exposes `teamOf`, `winnerOf` (BLUE/ORANGE aware, handles `teamCount`),
      `durationOf` (uses `date − settings.start` when `start`/`end` are
      absent), `netKills` (one clamping rule), `pilotKey` (case-insensitive,
      LIKE-escaped); every aggregation in `server/db.js` and
      `server/services/fightNightService.js` uses it; `isPilotFirstSeenOnDate`
      includes cold storage; `getPilotStats` stops hard-coding suicides to 0;
      the PilotsList K/D tooltip text is correct; tests on fixture games cover
      an ORANGE win, a tie, an FFA win, and a duration from `settings.start`.
- [ ] **S3 Data retention** (S). Done when: `getSummaryGames` selects games
      whose `details` lack a non-empty `kills` array; the page-1 upsert keeps
      the richer `details` when the incoming row has empty `kills`;
      `db.insertGame` calls `saveGames` directly; fight-night day queries use
      `date >= ? AND date < ?`; a test proves a hydrated fixture survives a
      summary upsert; backfill marks a fixture game `fetched`.
- [ ] **S4 Bundle and polling** (M). Done when: every view in `App.tsx` is
      `React.lazy`; `AudioEditor` mounts only on its tab; the root
      `public/ffmpeg-core.*` files are deleted; the wasm is served
      precompressed with a short cache for non-hashed files; one shared
      server-browser poll lives in a hook, pauses on `visibilitychange`, and
      `Layout` reads from it; the `/api/server/:ip/health` fetch is gone;
      `/api/games` returns cached rows without awaiting the upstream sync;
      `routes.js` no longer calls `refreshPilotStats` inline; `db.js` sets
      `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=NORMAL`, `busy_timeout=5000`;
      `refreshPilotStats` iterates rows. `npx vite build` shows the main chunk
      under 150 KB gzip.
- [ ] **S5 Indexed player table** (L). Done when: a `game_players` table
      (`game_id, date, name COLLATE NOCASE, team, kills, deaths, assists,
      damage, mode, map`) with indexes on `(name, date)` and `(date)` is
      populated by `saveGames` and a one-time migration; `/api/pilot/:name/*`
      and the leaderboard read from it; `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` shows index use;
      the remaining full passes run in a `worker_threads` worker on a
      read-only connection; the cold-storage move is atomic.
- [ ] **S6 Ops and types** (M). Done when: a nightly `db.backup()` of both
      databases with 7-day rotation; compose has log rotation and a healthcheck
      that hits an endpoint that queries the DB; `SIGTERM` closes the DB; the
      Dockerfile is multi-stage, non-root, `npm ci`, no build tools in the final
      image; `@types/react` installed and `tsc --noEmit` meaningful; CI runs
      `tsc`, `vite build` and tests on pull requests; 25 orphaned scripts and
      the root sample/leftover files are removed or moved (`new_map_data.json`
      and `maps_export.csv` move to `server/seed/`); `.github` pins Node 22.

### Phase 2: one system, one voice

- [ ] **S7 Live-first dashboard and match result** (M). Done when: the
      dashboard shows live servers and online pilots above a one-line Fight
      Night teaser; Fight Night is in the nav; the live match page shows the
      IP with a copy button that confirms; the match page shows final score or
      podium, winner, real duration and a result line; server favorites
      persist in `localStorage`; every hard-coded number listed in
      `docs/audit/ux.md` is wired to the API or removed.
- [ ] **S8 Links, titles, URL state** (M). Done when: internal navigation uses
      `<a href>` with click interception; `document.title` is set per route;
      the server catch-all injects `og:title`, `og:description` and
      `og:url` per route; tabs, filters, the map popup and the fight-night
      date are in the URL; back buttons call `history.back()`; the stale match
      flash is gone.
- [ ] **S9 Design tokens and shared states** (L). Done when:
      `tailwind.config.js` defines the palette (one orange, one hover orange,
      three surface blacks, one border), radius and type scale; dead classes
      are removed; `Loading`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorState` components exist and
      every view uses them; a top-level `ErrorBoundary` wraps the app; at
      least the dashboard, pilots, match and live pages are migrated to
      tokens.
- [ ] **S10 Glossary, accessibility, mobile** (M). Done when: one term each for
      match, pilot, kill, map, server, archive across the UI; "Combat Ratio"
      and "Lethality" have one definition; clickable rows and divs are buttons
      or links; `focus-visible` styles exist; dialogs have `role="dialog"` and
      close on Escape; every table has a scroll wrapper; the roster and map
      grid are paginated; `active:` states on tap targets.
- [ ] **S11 Split the giants** (L). Done when: `server/db.js` is split into
      connection, migrations, repos and analytics modules with unchanged
      exports; `routes.js` is one file per resource; `PilotSettingsPanel`,
      `AudioEditor`, `WebImportModal` and `AdminPanel` are each under 500
      lines with hooks extracted; `AdminPanel` uses `apiService` instead of
      axios.

### Phase 3: show the data like a fight

- [ ] **S12 Fight card, momentum, scrubber** (M). Match page: momentum chart
      with lead changes and weapon-colored kills; a time scrubber that replays
      the scoreboard from `kills[].time`.
- [ ] **S13 Rating and power rankings** (M). Glicko-2 from placement and
      corrected team results; nightly snapshot table; rating history line on
      the profile; `PowerRankings` view with weekly movement.
- [ ] **S14 Time and career** (M). 7×24 local-time heatmap on the dashboard;
      fight-night day boundary in the configured time zone; profile career
      arc sparklines, activity calendar and "last time out" block.
- [ ] **S15 Server history** (S). Persist server-browser snapshots; `/server/:ip`
      page with uptime, peak hours, average players; regional share over time.
- [ ] **S16 Weapon meta and ladders** (M). Weapon × map heatmap; weapon mix
      radar vs community; pilot × map grid; 1v1 duel ladder; CTF and
      Monsterball objective leaderboards.
- [ ] **S17 Rivalry network and damage flow** (L). Force graph from real kill
      edges; chord diagram of damage per match and career; clutch profile
      (first blood, late kills, kills while trailing).

### Phase 4: into Discord, and a reason to come back

- [ ] **S18 Discord webhook** (S). Recap embed on save; "it's on" ping once per
      evening; webhook URL as an admin setting.
- [ ] **S19 OG share cards** (M). PNG cards for pilot, match, fight night, map
      and tape URLs via satori + resvg.
- [ ] **S20 Tale of the Tape permalinks** (M). `/tape/:a/:b`.
- [ ] **S21 Belts and achievements** (M).
- [ ] **S22 Fight-night schedule and iCal** (S). Events table, `.ics` feed,
      dashboard countdown; remove the calendar iframe.
- [ ] **S23 Maps and hosts** (S). Map of the week, `/author/:name`, nightly
      map sync, host pages.
- [ ] **S24 Loadout share codes** (M).
- [ ] **S25 AI ring announcer** (S). One grounded narration per fight night,
      admin-triggered, cached; remove the per-match Gemini route.
- [ ] **S26 Season Wrapped** (L).
- [ ] **S27 Discord login, pilot claim, aliases** (L).
- [ ] **S28 Taunt library, RSVP, nemesis push** (L). Depends on S27.

## Decisions and deviations

- 2026-10-06: Work is split into one-item sessions in fresh contexts because the
  audits alone consumed four agents' worth of context; a single long session
  would lose the file:line evidence. Rejected: one big branch.
- 2026-10-06: The tracker lives in the repo (`docs/`) rather than only in the
  published page, so every PR carries its own status. The HTML page is the
  narrative; this file is the queue.
- 2026-10-06: Test runner for the server is vitest, added in S1, because the
  repo has no runner, vitest needs no transform config for ES modules, and the
  client is already on Vite. Rejected: node:test (no watch or coverage
  conventions shared with the client).
- 2026-10-06: Keep the JSON-blob `games` table as the source of truth and add
  `game_players` beside it (S5), rather than normalising everything. The cold
  DB is about 2.8 GB; a full rewrite on the NAS is not worth the risk.
- 2026-10-06 (S1): The script half of S1 is the owner's commit `5516729`, not
  S1's. S1 first fixed the five scripts itself (env or `getpass`), then
  rebased onto the rewritten `main` and dropped those changes. Env-only with
  an exit when unset meets "read from env or prompt". `.gitignore` keeps the
  owner's `.env.*` rule and adds `!.env.example`.
- 2026-10-06 (S1): Both compose files now pass `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and
  `SESSION_SECRET` through from the host environment. With `admin123` still
  hard-coded there, the startup check could never fire in production.
- 2026-10-06 (S1): "Pilot-file routes" means everything under
  `/api/overload/*`, including `install`, `status`, `taunts` and `audio`. The
  `/api/import/*` routes in the same router stay public because the public
  taunt maker uses them; see "Flagged, not fixed".
- 2026-10-06 (S1): Login rate limit uses `express-rate-limit` (10 failures per
  IP and 50 across all clients per 15 minutes, successes not counted) rather
  than a hand-rolled map.
  `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` makes `req.ip` the client behind the DSM proxy
  and lets `cookie.secure: 'auto'` mark the cookie `Secure` on HTTPS while
  LAN access over plain HTTP keeps working.
- 2026-10-06 (S1): `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is compared as a SHA-256 digest with
  `timingSafeEqual`, so the bcrypt hash of `admin123` and the `bcryptjs`
  dependency are gone.
- 2026-10-06 (S1): Compose uses `${ADMIN_PASSWORD:?...}`, so a NAS without
  `.env` fails at `docker-compose up` instead of starting a container that
  exits and restarts in a loop.
- 2026-10-06 (S1): The pilot-name check lives in each `overloadBridge.js`
  function that builds a path, and returns that function's existing failure
  shape (null, `{ error }` or `{ success: false }`), so routes did not change.
- Closed, do not re-propose: one-click join via an `olmod://` protocol. The
  olmod README documents no URL handler; this is an upstream change.
- Closed, do not re-propose: league standings or brackets. otl.gg owns them.

## Flagged, not fixed

- `server/services/overloadBridge.js` duplicates the browser-side bridge with a
  hard-coded Windows path and never works on the NAS. Candidate for deletion
  after S1 locks it behind auth; decide in S11.
- `services/mockDataService.ts` (empty), `utils/audio-tool/*`,
  `utils/testPresets.ts`, four unused `apiService` exports,
  `server/debug_stats.js`, dead second attach at `db.js:962-969`. Removed in
  S6.
- `cacheService.js` tries Redis on every boot and never sweeps expired keys.
  Fix in S4 if time allows, otherwise S6.
- The README promises ELO; none exists. Satisfied by S13.
- (S1) `/api/import/*` (yt-dlp search, extract, stream, archive.org proxy)
  has no auth and no rate limit. The public taunt maker needs it, so locking
  it is a product decision. A per-IP limit fits S4 or S6.
- (S1) Anyone who reaches port 3000 directly, without the DSM proxy, can set
  `X-Forwarded-For` and get a fresh per-IP bucket. S1 adds a cap of 50
  failures across all clients per 15 minutes, which bounds brute force but
  lets an attacker lock the admin out for 15 minutes. Publishing port 3000
  only to the proxy host would let `trust proxy` name that host.
- (S1) `POST /api/analyze-match` is admin-only per the Done-when list, but the
  match page still shows the AI analysis button to everyone. Visitors get
  "Error: Unauthorized - Admin access required". S25 removes the route.
- (S1) The taunt tool's server-native mode (server running on the Windows PC
  with Overload) now needs an admin login first. Without one,
  `/api/overload/status` returns 401 and the page falls back to the browser
  folder picker with no hint to log in.
- (S1) `listPilots` lists every file stem, but every pilot operation rejects
  names outside `^[A-Za-z0-9 _.-]{1,32}$`. A pilot named, say, `[OFC]Kehoe`
  shows up and then cannot be opened, renamed or deleted through the site.
  Overload's own rules for pilot names were not checked.
- (S1) `login` does not call `req.session.regenerate()`, so the session ID
  survives login (session fixation). Sessions use the in-memory store, which
  leaks and resets on restart.
- (S1) `express.json({ limit: '50mb' })` applies to every route, not only the
  taunt install, and runs before the login rate limiter, so a client over the
  limit can still make the server parse a 50 MB body.
- (S1) `/api/overload/audio` guards paths with `path.normalize` and a regex
  strip rather than a resolved-prefix check. It is admin-only now.
- (S1) `/api/ppi` still runs `refreshPilotStats` inline for anyone. S4 owns
  it.

## Rollback

Each session is one PR. Rollback is `git revert` of that merge commit followed
by a NAS image pull. S5 adds a table and a migration; its rollback drops the
table (the JSON blobs remain the source of truth, so no data is lost).

## Open questions

- The time zone for fight-night day boundaries (US Central is the likely
  answer given the server names). Decided in S14; ask the user at the start of
  that session.

## Skills to load

- `unslop` for PR descriptions and tracker prose.
- `code-review` at the end of each session, before opening the PR.
- `simplify` after the review, on the session's diff.

## Postmortems

### better-sqlite3 11.8 on Node 24

`npm ci` fails compiling `better-sqlite3@11.8.1` on Node 24.6. Use `nvm use 22`
(22.17.0 installed) or `npm ci --ignore-scripts` for a client-only build.
Measured 2026-10-06.

### `npm run build` rewrites a tracked file

`prebuild` runs `scripts/generate-version.js`, which rewrites
`public/version.json` and dirties the tree. Use `npx vite build` for
measurement builds. The deploy workflow relies on the rewrite; leave it alone.

## Session log

- 2026-10-06, planning session (Claude Fable 5.1): four audits, roadmap page
  published, this tracker written. No code changed.
- 2026-10-06, S1 (Claude Opus 5.5): secrets out of five scripts, production
  refuses to start without its two secrets, admin session on `/api/overload/*`,
  analyze-match and fight-nights/check, pilot-name validation, login rate
  limit, `Secure` cookie on HTTPS, `.env.example`, vitest. Status line checked
  first: `10223be` was still `origin/main`, and the docs branch existed. The
  tracker undercounted the leaked password (three scripts listed, five had
  it). First server start in this work, on Node 22; `better-sqlite3` compiles
  there. /code-review found 10 issues: fixed the spoofable rate limit (global
  cap), compose starting without secrets (`:?`), password-length timing
  (digest compare) and a misleading dev warning; the rest are flagged above.
  /simplify: made `verifyPassword` sync, hashed the admin password once, moved
  `renamePilot`'s name check ahead of `tasklist`. Skipped folding the eight
  pilot-name guards into one throwing path helper (it would turn 400/404 into
  500) and moving the production check out of `auth.js` (index.js body runs
  after `db.js` has opened the databases). Push denied (`kehoej` has read
  access only), so the branch is local and no PR exists yet.
- 2026-10-06, S1 resumed (Claude Opus 5.5): push access granted. `git fetch`
  showed `main` force-pushed: the owner purged the password from history
  (`10223be` became `2c4f174`, code otherwise identical) and added
  `5516729`, which fixes the scripts. Rebuilt `ofc/s01-secrets-auth` on
  `5516729` by cherry-picking the S1 commits, took the owner's scripts and
  `.gitignore`, and added `!.env.example`. Checked that no commit from the old
  history is an ancestor and that none of the 46 objects pushed contains the
  password. Re-ran vitest and the production start checks on the new base.
  PR __PR__, not merged.

## Next session prompt

Copy everything inside the fence into a new conversation.

```
Continue the overloadfight.club roadmap. This session is S2: stat correctness.

Repo: git@github.com:jasonjkehoe-alt/overloadfight.club.git. Work in this worktree only.
The queue is docs/ROADMAP.md. Read it in full first, then verify its status line against the repo before building on anything in it.

The owner rewrote history on 2026-10-06 to purge a leaked password. Work only from a clone made after that date. Before any push, check that `git merge-base --is-ancestor 10223be HEAD` fails (10223be is the pre-rewrite base); if it succeeds, stop and tell me.

Set up:
  git fetch origin
  If the S1 PR (branch ofc/s01-secrets-auth) is merged:
    git checkout -B ofc/s02-stat-correctness origin/main
  If it is still open:
    git checkout -B ofc/s02-stat-correctness origin/ofc/s01-secrets-auth
    and open the S2 PR against main anyway; say in its description that it sits on S1.
  nvm use 22
  npm ci
If neither origin/main nor origin/ofc/s01-secrets-auth has docs/ROADMAP.md, stop and tell me.

Read first:
- docs/ROADMAP.md, the S2 entry and its Done-when list. That list is the scope.
- docs/audit/data.md, "Correctness bugs" items 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, for the file:line evidence (refs are as of 10223be, which is 2c4f174 after the rewrite; re-find them with grep -n).
- server/db.js around the cited lines, server/services/fightNightService.js, and the K/D tooltip in components/PilotsList.tsx (read in sections; a hook blocks whole-file reads over 350 lines, use sed -n 'START,ENDp').
- types.ts and the fixture files gamelist_sample.json and game_detail_sample.json at the repo root.

Binding decisions, do not re-derive:
- Test runner is vitest (added in S1; `npx vitest run`). Tests live beside the code as *.test.js.
- One shared module, server/lib/gameParse.js, owns teamOf, winnerOf, durationOf, netKills and pilotKey. Every aggregation in server/db.js and fightNightService.js calls it; no second copy of the rules.
- Teams are BLUE and ORANGE. winnerOf handles teamCount > 2 and FFA. A tie is a tie, not a BLUE win.
- durationOf uses date - settings.start when start/end are absent, before any timeLimit fallback.
- pilotKey is case-insensitive and escapes LIKE wildcards.
- Do not change the games table, the hot/cold split or the public API paths (see "Canonical contract"). Do not add the game_players table; that is S5.
- No production database exists locally. Prove each fix with a test on fixture games, built from the sample JSON files.

Rules for this session:
- One PR, scope is the S2 Done-when list only. Flag anything else in the tracker's "Flagged, not fixed".
- Do not merge the PR. Do not push to main.
- No Co-Authored-By or attribution trailers in commits.
- Apply the unslop skill to the PR description and tracker prose.
- Run /code-review on the diff before opening the PR, then /simplify, and fix what they find.
- Before ending: tick S2 in docs/ROADMAP.md, fill Validated and NOT validated with what you actually ran and its output, update the Verification table rows you exercised, correct the counts in the Status section, append to the session log, and rewrite the "Next session prompt" section for S3 using this prompt as the template. Commit that in the same PR.
- End the turn after the PR is open. Do not start S3.

Load these skills: unslop, code-review, simplify.

First move: run `npx vitest run` and `grep -n "teamScore" server/db.js server/services/fightNightService.js`, and record both results.
Done when: every item in the S2 Done-when list is true, `npx vitest run` passes with tests for an ORANGE win, a tie, an FFA win and a duration from settings.start, `PORT=3100 DATA_DIR=/tmp/ofc-data npm start` (dev mode, no secrets needed) still serves `/api/stats/global`, and the PR is open with the tracker updated.
```
